# Hi, I'm Tiffany — a Cybersecurity Analyst with a GRC Focus 🛡️

I'm passionate about bridging security and compliance through **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)**.  
I create real-world labs and documentation that simulate enterprise GRC workflows  from vendor risk assessments to policy development and control mapping.
